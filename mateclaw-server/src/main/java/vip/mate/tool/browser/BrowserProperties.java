 * <p>Precedence when launching (highest first):
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link #cdpUrl} — connect to an already-running Chrome via DevTools Protocol</li>
 *   <li>{@link #chromePath} or {@code CHROME_PATH} env — explicit executable</li>
 *   <li>{@link #channel} — Playwright channel ("chrome", "msedge", ...)</li>
 *   <li>Auto-detect system Chrome/Edge/Brave on well-known paths</li>
 *   <li>Playwright's bundled Chromium (requires {@code playwright install})</li>
 *   <li>External-process CDP launch (run system chrome with --remote-debugging-port and attach)</li>
